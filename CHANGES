This file documents the changes between released versions of OKUSON.

How to apply an update of OKUSON to earlier releases:
-----------------------------------------------------

In case that you have customized only those file which you have copies from
sample files (Config.xml.sample -> Config.xml, html.sample/* -> html, 
data/empty/* -> data):
  Just unpack the newer archive in the same location where you have unpacked
  an earlier version. 

Otherwise:
  Save files which you have changed and which are not mentioned above.
  Unpack the newer archive. Reapply your changes. (Actually, you may tell
  us which files you want to change, maybe this can be avoided by improving
  the files in the distribution.)


Changes from 1.0-pre1  to  1.0-pre2
-----------------------------------
* removed bug with redisplaying sheets including previous submissions.
* the ./stop and ./restart scripts no longer need the administrator
  password (thereby removing a problem with passwords containing '&'
  characters)
* changed default for access of BuiltinWebServer: from all hosts
