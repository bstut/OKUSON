This file documents the changes between released versions of OKUSON.

How to apply an update of OKUSON to earlier releases:
-----------------------------------------------------

          See the separate file UPGRADE for upgrades from before 1.0.

   Upgrading instructions for upgrade from version 1.0:

          Just extract the new archive. The only files that are changed are:
            html.sample/edithomeworkperson.tpl
            server/fmTools/AsciiData.py
            doc/manual.tex
            doc/manual.pdf
            CHANGES
            VERSION

Changes from 1.0 to 1.0-fix1
----------------------------

* Small layout change in html.sample/edithomeworkperson.tpl.
* The following nasty bug has been reported by Thorsten:

  In questions of type "c" (choice) the data format used to store submissions
  did not distinguish between two cases:
   (1) The participant selects no option and says "this is my answer"
   (2) The participant selects no option and says "I do not answer"
  This is nasty, because actual information is lost and we cannot 
  retrieve it any more (see below).

  Details about the problem:

  The problem is that the choice of options selected is stored as a comma
  separated list and the additional information "I do not answer" is stored
  as an additional empty string in the comma separated list. However, we
  did not distinguish the case of an empty list and the list that contains
  exactly one empty string.
  This is now fixed, the empty list is stored differently. 
  Now the map from the set of lists of strings to external representations
  is injective.

  Consequences:

  - All data currently in your files is read exactly as before the fix.
  - No data conversion whatsoever has to happen.
  - In all cases where participants selected no option the current data
    is read as if they had selected "I do not answer", resulting in 0
    points.
  - The information, that some participants conciously selected no option
    is lost and cannot be retrieved automatically. One has to find a decent
    solution for those participants.
  - From now on this case is handled properly.



Changes from 1.0-pre4  to  1.0
------------------------------

* added support for ExamGradingFunction to automatically calculate messages
  and grades for results of exams. This should now complete the support
  for exams.
* added 'Content-Disposition' header line for PDF sheets
* fixed nasty bug in scripts/distribute.py
* documentation of external data formats as far as the user is concerned
* documentation of internal data formats as far as necessary for automatic
  grading functions and for overview
* documentation of automatic grading
* documentation of handling of exams
* documented missing interface elements
* added an example of needed resources
* chapter with customization examples
* cleanup pyRXP directory after build
* allow group number 0 in tutor input pages
* added some utilities to 'scripts' subdirectory
* improved 'testsheet' for optionally using the NoTable template (-n option)
* guest IDs are no longer members of groups (in cache in GroupInfo objects)
* sorting of IDs consistent (numerical if possible)

  images)
* made tutors page more user friendly by adding name column and separating
  lines
* added a script to remove a person from all data files when server
  is *not* running. Please pay ATTENTION to your data when using this!
* fixed bug with SHEETS element in .bla files reported by Ingo
* now floating point entries are allowed in homework excercises (this uses
  new "FLOAT" and "NUMBER" types in the AsciiData module
* changed log entries: validation only logs message if not successful,
  and for main user/sheet dependend pages a log-message now shows the id
  and sheet number (before the standard webserver line)
* the builtin webserver now waits some maximal number of seconds on
  terminating threads (set via BuiltinWebServer.TERMWAIT, default 3 sec)
* with 'testsheet' the questions of interactive exercises are now separated
  by a thin empty line

Changes from 1.0-pre3  to  1.0-pre4
-----------------------------------

* remove sending of "Location" header at administrator login to please opera
* fixed validity bug in /doctypehelp.tpl
* added correction of "Content-length" header in NoValidFunction after
  removal of validation icon, this fixes a nasty behaviour with opera
* added explicit Path to Set-Cookie header
* introduced PDF template without table for courses without interactive
  exercises and attribute for using it; added some corresponding alternative
  .tpl files (called .tpl.nointeractive)
* added pseudo elements for getting radio button and check box corresponding
  to persondataX components
* new pseudo element for select options with persondataX values
* made group 0 a valid group, so it doesn't need the groups.txt file in case
  of just one group (but put an entry with password in groupinfo.txt to use
  the /tutors.html interface)

Changes from 1.0-pre2  to  1.0-pre3
-----------------------------------
Attention: The following four configuration options are new in the file
           Config.xml.sample:
             DocumentRoot, GroupInfoFile, GradingFunction, GradingActive,
             and GuestIdRegExp.
           They are all optional and have sensible defaults.

* removed bug with double use of <Semester/>.
* introduced the 'openfrom' attribute for sheets, including admin
  access to not yet open sheets via administrator menu.
* sensible messages for 'start' when server already running and for 'stop'
  when no server is running.
* introduced on the fly validation of delivered XHTML pages to the 
  BuiltinWebServer, in OKUSON's Server nonvalid files are written to 
  temporary directories and in that case the validator icon is removed.
  Corrected a few errors detected by this in html.sample directory:
    adminlogin.tpl, generalinfo.tpl, results.tpl, sheet.tpl
* improved the <Results > element used in html/results.tpl, now the
  consideration of each of the interactive resp. homework exercises can 
  can be switched off.

  entry GroupInfoFile in "Config.xml"!
* added convenient deletion of private messages by administrator
* several improvements (we think) in sample OKUSON.css style sheet
* new optional configuration options "GradingFunction" and
  "GradingActive", which allow automatic grading.
* display of grades based on automatic decision via the GradingFunction 
  in the result page.
* added feature to register (and unregister) for exams
* export of registered participants for exam via administrator menu
* only allow super-password access from administrator enabled client hosts
* pages for tutors to change group password and to enter homework results
  for people in their group, by sheet and by person (for all sheets)
* introduce guest ID (usually 100000) via a configuration option
  GuestIdRegExp (optional, defaults to ^$ which matches only the empty
  id). Guest IDs do not appear in exports and one can authenticate to
  them with any password, even the empty one.
* added export of results including multiple choice, homework, and exams
* corrected a nasty bug with "choice" exercises
* added possibility to resubmit all submissions for a sheet to correct
  potential errors in the "correct solutions".
