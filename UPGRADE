 This file describes the upgrade procedure from OKUSON 1.1-fix5 
                                             to OKUSON 1.2-fix1:

(If you have already installed OKUSON 1.2 successfully there is probably no
reason to upgrade to 1.2-fix1.)

Just stop the server, unpack the new archive over your installation and
restart the server:

  cd okuson
  ./stop
  cd ..
  tar xzvf okuson-1.2-fix1.tar.gz
  cd okuson
  ./start

Unpacking the archive does *not* overwrite the following customizable files:
  html/*
  Config.xml
  data/*.txt

Note that there are 3 new configuration options in Config.xml, namely:
  MCScoreCorrectDefault
  MCScoreWrongDefault
  MCScoreExerciseLowerLimitDefault

However, they have sensible default values, such that an old Config.xml
will still work as before.

There is a changed template file in html.sample:
  adminmenu.tpl
You should copy this to your html directory:
  cp html.sample/adminmenu.tpl html

There are a number of new template files in html.sample:
  errors/unknownextension.tpl
  publicstatistics.tpl
  tutorextensions.tpl
  highscoretable.tpl
  extension.tpl

You have to copy these files to the html directory, if you want to use some
of the new plugins (see below).

If you have applied any patches to the server programs, make sure to 
reapply them.

If you want to use any of the new plugins, you will have to activate them
by copying things from server/plugins.sample to server/plugins. For specific
plugins see doc/plugins for further instructions.

Have fun!
