Small HOWTO for releasing versions.

0) Change VERSION file.
1) Maybe adjust UPGRADE file.
2) Maybe make a new git branch for the release version.
3) Clone git repository for building the archive:
     mkdir ../build
     cd ../build
     git clone -b rel1.4.x ../OKUSON
4) Go to this new directory:
   cd OKUSON
5) Make archive:
   ./makeArchive
   (the exported tree is modified substantially!)
   You find ../okuson-1.*.pdf and ../okuson-1.*.tar.gz .
6) Copy those to  a checked out okuson directory and
   cd to that directory.

7) Adjust links and maybe text in website/index.html.

8) Update web site with:
     cd website
     ./cptoweb

7) Inform interested user.
