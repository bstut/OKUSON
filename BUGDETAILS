This file contains some detail information on old bugs, which have been
fixed.

* The following nasty bug has been reported by Thorsten:

  In questions of type "c" (choice) the data format used to store submissions
  did not distinguish between two cases:
   (1) The participant selects no option and says "this is my answer"
   (2) The participant selects no option and says "I do not answer"
  This is nasty, because actual information is lost and we cannot 
  retrieve it any more (see below).

  Details about the problem:

  The problem is that the choice of options selected is stored as a comma
  separated list and the additional information "I do not answer" is stored
  as an additional empty string in the comma separated list. However, we
  did not distinguish the case of an empty list and the list that contains
  exactly one empty string.
  This is now fixed, the empty list is stored differently. 
  Now the map from the set of lists of strings to external representations
  is injective.

  Consequences:

  - All data currently in your files is read exactly as before the fix.
  - No data conversion whatsoever has to happen.
  - In all cases where participants selected no option the current data
    is read as if they had selected "I do not answer", resulting in 0
    points.
  - The information, that some participants conciously selected no option
    is lost and cannot be retrieved automatically. One has to find a decent
    solution for those participants.
  - From now on this case is handled properly.

  This bug was fixed in 1.0-fix1.
