Just stop the server, unpack the new archive over your installation and
restart the server:

  cd okuson
  ./stop
  cd ..
  tar xzvf okuson-1.1-fix2.tar.gz
  cd okuson
  ./start

Unpacking the archive does *not* overwrite the following customizable files:
  html/*
  Config.xml
  data/*.txt

There are a few small changes in the web page templates, maybe you want to
copy them from html.sample/ to html/ :
  html.sample/favicon.ico          (new) a default address line icon
  html.sample/tutors.tpl           function to access group statistics
  html.sample/globalstatistics.tpl shows current group number
  html.sample/adminmenu.tpl        function to move participant to other group
  html.sample/*.tpl                added small "(OKUSON 1.1-fix2)" at the end

So, if you didn't apply any changes to the default .tpl files just copy
  cp -r html.sample html
Otherwise, if you didn't touch the defaults of the first four files,
you may want:
  cp html.sample/{tutors.tpl,globalstatistics.tpl,adminmenu.tpl} html
  cp html.sample/favicon.ico html

If you applied any patches to the server programs, make sure to reapply them.

Have fun!
