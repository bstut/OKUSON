This file documents the changes between released versions of OKUSON.

How to apply an update of OKUSON to earlier releases:
-----------------------------------------------------

In case that you have customized only those file which you have copies from
sample files (Config.xml.sample -> Config.xml, html.sample/* -> html, 
data/empty/* -> data):
  Just unpack the newer archive in the same location where you have unpacked
  an earlier version. 

Otherwise:
  Save files which you have changed and which are not mentioned above.
  Unpack the newer archive. Reapply your changes. (Actually, you may tell
  us which files you want to change, maybe this can be avoided by improving
  the files in the distribution.)

Changes from 1.0-pre2  to  1.0-pre3
-----------------------------------
Attention: The following four configuration options are new in the file
           Config.xml.sample:
             DocumentRoot, GroupInfoFile, GradingFunction, and GradingActive.
           They are all optional and have sensible defaults.

* removed bug with double use of <Semester/>.
* introduced the 'openfrom' attribute for sheets, including admin
  access to not yet open sheets via administrator menu.
* sensible messages for 'start' when server already running and for 'stop'
  when no server is running.
* introduced on the fly validation of delivered XHTML pages to the 
  BuiltinWebServer, in OKUSON's Server nonvalid files are written to 
  temporary directories and in that case the validator icon is removed.
  Corrected a few errors detected by this in html.sample directory:
    adminlogin.tpl, generalinfo.tpl, results.tpl, sheet.tpl
* improved the <Results > element used in html/results.tpl, now the
  consideration of each of the interactive resp. homework exercises can 
  can be switched off.
* remove temporary files for PDF sheets.
* removed bug that made page with distribution into exercises classes nonvalid
* added export of people for distribution into groups
* added helper scripts to facilitate distribution in a semi-automatic way
* document this process in the manual under "Managing Participants"
* distribution into exercise classes should now be ready for usage
* added configuration option 'DocumentRoot', this changes "Config.xml"!
* added a few sanity checks at startup 
* added export facility for people including group membership, documented
* added sort functionality for export of people
* added option to send personal message to participant via admin menu
* re-styled administrator's menu
* moved files in server/Tools to a subpackage 'fmTools'
* added data structure for general information on tutoring groups, new 
  entry GroupInfoFile in "Config.xml"!
* added convenient deletion of private messages by administrator
* several improvements (we think) in sample OKUSON.css style sheet
* new optional configuration options "GradingFunction" and
  "GradingActive", which allow automatic grading.
* display of grades based on automatic decision via the GradingFunction 
  in the result page.
* added feature to register (and unregister) for exams
* export of registered participants for exam via administrator menu
* only allow super-password access from administrator enabled client hosts
* pages for tutors to change group password and to enter homework results
  for people in their group, by sheet and by person (for all sheets)
* introduce guest ID (usually 100000) via a configuration option
  GuestIdRegExp (optional, defaults to ^$ which matches only the empty
  id). Guest IDs do not appear in exports and one can authenticate to
  them with any password, even the empty one.
* added export of results including multiple choice, homework, and exams
* corrected a nasty bug with "choice" exercises
* added possibility to resubmit all submissions for a sheet to correct
  potential errors in the "correct solutions".

Changes from 1.0-pre1  to  1.0-pre2
-----------------------------------
* removed bug with redisplaying sheets including previous submissions.
* the ./stop and ./restart scripts no longer need the administrator
  password (thereby removing a problem with passwords containing '&'
  characters)
* changed default for access of BuiltinWebServer: from all hosts
