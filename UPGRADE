 Instructions to upgrade from version 1.0-fix2 to 1.0-fix3
===========================================================

From now on we recommend using Python version 2.3 or newer, since timeouts
on network connections are only available in Python >= 2.3. The timeouts
are used to get rid of "hanging threads", which consume a little bit of
memory until the next server restart.
It is absolutely safe to go on using Python 2.2, though.

Installation:

Unpack the archive:

  tar xzvf okuson-1.0-fix3.tar.gz

outside the "okuson" directory.

You have to recompile the pyRXP parser, since a bug has been fixed within
pyRXP. You do this by the following commands:

  cd okuson/server
  ./makepyRXP
  cd ..
  
Several program files are replaced, however your configuration file, the
data files, and the web page templates are not changed automatically.

The following new files have to be copied manually from the "html.sample"
directory to the "html" directory (do the following from the "okuson" dir):

  cp html.sample/OKUSONStatistics.css html
  cp html.sample/exercisestatistics.tpl html
  cp html.sample/globalstatistics.tpl html
  cp html.sample/globalstatisticspergroup.tpl html
and:
  cp html.sample/images/red.png html/images

The following modified files have to be copied manually from the "html.sample"
directory to the "html" directory to use the new statistic functions:

  cp html.sample/adminmenu.tpl html
  
The following modified files have to be copied manually from the "html.sample"
directory to the "html" directory to use the new display of maximal possible
scores (beware, you could possibly have edited "results.tpl" yourself):

  cp html.sample/results.tpl html
  cp html.sample/results.tpl.nointeractive html
     (copy this to "html.sample/results.tpl" if you do not use MC exercises)

There was a little layout change in "regchange2.tpl", which you can 
activate with the following command:

  cp html.sample/regchange2.tpl html

Beware if you have edited this file yourselve!

You can use the new utility script "showdiffsintemplates" to display the
files in your html directory, which differ from those in the distribution's
html.sample directory:

  scripts/shopwdiffsintemplates -q
or
  scripts/shopwdiffsintemplates
