 Instructions to upgrade from version 1.0-fix2 to 1.0-fix3
===========================================================

From now on we recommend using Python version 2.3 or newer, since timeouts
on network connections are only available in Python >= 2.3. The timeouts
are used to get rid of "hanging threads", which consume a little bit of
memory until the next server restart.
It is absolutely safe to go on using Python 2.2, though.

Installation:

Unpack the archive:

  tar xzvf okuson-1.0-fix3.tar.gz

outside the "okuson" directory.

Several program files are replaced, however your configuration, data,
and web page templates are not changed.

The following new files have to be copied manually from the
  html.sample
directory to the
  html
directory:
