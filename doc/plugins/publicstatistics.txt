USAGE IN DETAIL
===============

Calling this plugin will yield a table depicting how many participants
reached certain points in exercises or exams. No IDs are displayed, so you
can consider this data to be anonymous (unless you are managing a course
with two participants only ...).

The publicstatistics extension can be accessed in .tpl files via the
ExtensionCode tag. One example is

<ExtensionCode name="PublicStatistics" field="totalscore" showmax="yes"
 titles="points to reach up to now:points:frequencies:cumulated"
 fracreturned="0.5" />

(you will find more in html/publicstatistics.tpl). In the following we are
going to explain the meaning of the arguments.

name            the name of the extension to use; in order to refer to the
                publicstatistics plugin, it has to be set to
                "PublicStatistics"
                
field           the data used for the statistics; the following entries
                are possible:
                
                * "totalscore":     the sum of points in all interactive and
                                    homework exercises
                * "totalmcscore":   the sum of points in all interactive
                                    exercises
                * "totalhomescore": the sum of points in all homework
                                    exercises
                * "examscore":      the sum of points over all exams
                
                These entries may be followed by a "+"-separated list of
                sheet/exam numbers. This will restrict the statistics to the
                specified sheets/exams. So "totalhomescore10" will yield a
                table for the homework points reached in sheet number 10, and
                "examscore0+1" will yield a table for the sum of points
                reached in exams number 0 and 1 together.
                                    
showmax         determines whether the maximally attainable points are
                displayed ("yes"/"no"); if this is activated, the points in
                the table are also presented as percentage of this maximum
                
titles          the colon-separated list of table captions; the first title
                is used for the maximally attainable points (if showmax is
                "yes"), the next for the points, the third for the
                displayed frequencies, and the last for the cumulated
                frequencies

fracreturned    the fraction of sheets/exams a participant had to return
                to be included in this statistics (if you do not want to
                include participants who just returned the first two or
                three sheets and then left the course, you should for example
                set this value to "0.4" -- then only those participants
                who returned at least 40% of the sheets are considered;
                for exams it may be sensible to set this value to "1" to
                exclude those participants who did not take part in all
                of the exams in question)
