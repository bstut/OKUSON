To upgrade to 1.0-pre3 you have to do the following:

1) Extract the archive over the old installation:

   gzip -dc okuson-XXX.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   (outside the "okuson" directory!)

2) cd okuson

3) ./upgrade

   This will install new versions of the web pages and add a new data file.
   Also the files data/homework.txt and data/examregistrations.txt are
   overwritten, because their format has changed. Due to severe restrictions
   in the functionality of version 1.0-pre2 these files will be empty
   anyway in your installation.

   The following files for the web pages have been changed and therefore
   have to be overwritten with the new version:

     adminlogin.tpl
     adminmenu.tpl
     generalinfo.tpl
     index.tpl
     messages/subsuccess.tpl
     OKUSON.css
     results.tpl
     sheet.tpl

   If you have edited them, you have to reapply your changes.
   
   Please see the upgrade script for a list of new files.

4) Optionally adjust new configuration options. 

   The following new options now exist in Config.xml:

     GuestIdRegExp
     GradingFunction
     GradingActive
     DocumentRoot
     GroupInfoFile

   They are all optional and have sensible defaults, so you do not have
   to do anything, although you may lose functionality, if you ignore them.

   The value of the following configuration options has changed and has
   to be edited into your configuration file:

     AdministrationAccessList
     PDFTemplate (!)

   The change to the latter fixes a bug and is therefore necessary.

   The comments in Config.xml.sample have been improved in quite a few
   places so it may be worthwhile to start with the new Config.xml.sample
   and reapply your changes!

Note that you do *not* have to recompile or to follow the other steps of the
first time installation instructions in the manual.
